        (c) your registration and your use of the Services complies with all

        Services, you may be required to register for an account and agree to a
        Product’s Terms, to the extent applicable to that service, which may be
        incorporated herein or available on a separate <span className="text-cyan-600 font-extrabold ">Rently</span> Companies site.
        When you register for an account you will be asked to provide us with
        some information about yourself, such as email address, phone number, or
        other contact information. You agree that the information you provide is

        have entered into a commercial agreement with us permitting you to use
        the Services for transactions on behalf of another person, you may use
        the Services only for transactions on your own behalf.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-10">
      <span className="font-extrabold">4 . </span> Fees. A. Generally. You may be required to pay fees to access certain
        features of the Services. All fees are in U.S. dollars and are
        non-refundable. If we change the fees for all or part of any of the
        Services, including by adding fees or charges, we will provide you
        advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, we
        may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Services to you.
        Our authorized third-party payment processors will charge the payment
        method you specified at the time of purchase or as agreed to as part of
        the selected Service. You authorize us to charge all fees as described
        in these Terms of Use for the Services you select to that payment
        method. If you pay any fees with a credit card, we may seek
        pre-authorization of your credit card account before your purchase to
        verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or
        credit available to cover your purchase. B. Subscriptions. The Services
        may include features that allow for automatically recurring payments for
        periodic charges (“Subscription Service”). If you decide to activate a
        Subscription Service, you authorize us to periodically charge, on a
        going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring
        payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due
        date for the accrued sums. The subscription will continue unless and
        until you cancel your subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel
        your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of
        the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the
        periodic subscription fee to the payment method you provide to us during
        registration (or to a different payment method if you change your
        payment information). We may change the subscription fee for any
        subsequent subscription period but will provide you advance notice of
        any increase before it applies. Unless otherwise stated in your
        Product’s Terms, you may cancel a Subscription Service through the
        settings page in your account.
